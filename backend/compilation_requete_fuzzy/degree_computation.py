def convert_note_to_sharp(note: str) -> str:

    Convert a note to its equivalent in sharp (if it is a flat).
    If the note has no accidental, it is not modified.

    - note : a string of length 1 or 2 representing a musical note class (no octave).
             Sharp can be represented either with 's' or '#'.
             Flat can be represented either with 'f' of 'b'.

    Output: `note` with sharp represented as '#', or `note` unchanged if there was no accidental.
